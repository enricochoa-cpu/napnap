## P1 — Important

---

## P2 — Nice to have

### U-32 — No retry button in error banner

- **Effort**: Medium
- **Impact**: Low
- **Location**: `App.tsx:644-650`
- **Problem**: Global error banner shows "Something went wrong loading your data. Pull down to refresh." — text-only, no interactive retry button. User must manually pull-to-refresh or reload the page.
- **Fix**: Add a "Tap to retry" button in the banner that calls refresh/refetch from data hooks.

### U-34 — No tablet/desktop responsive layouts

- **Effort**: High
- **Impact**: Low
- **Location**: App-wide
- **Problem**: No `lg:` breakpoint layouts. App works on larger screens but doesn't use extra space. Low priority given mobile-first target user.
- **Fix**: Add `lg:` breakpoints for wider viewports (two-column Stats, wider cards, centered containers).

### U-47 — Today's incomplete data looks alarming in charts (§10.3)

- **Effort**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Location**: `StatsView` (charts)
- **Problem**: Today shows a tiny sliver / sharp drop in bar and area charts because the day isn't over yet. Looks like "something went wrong."
- **Fix**: Mark today's bar with dashed outline + "in progress" pill badge. Or exclude today from trend calculations and show separately as "Today so far."

### U-48 — HORARI DIARI too small for mobile (§10.4)

- **Effort**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Location**: `StatsView` (Gantt)
- **Problem**: Gantt-style daily schedule chart has small colored dots. 6-item legend. Dots too small for comfortable phone reading on 390px screens.
- **Fix**: Increase dot/bar size to min 8px (ideally 12px). Add one-line insight card above. Add time-of-day background bands. Consider tappable rows.

### U-49 — Date range picker needs native segmented control (§10.5)

- **Effort**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Location**: `StatsView` (picker)
- **Problem**: Max 15-day range with no indication. No presets. "7d" badge looks like a label, not interactive.
- **Fix**: Replace with native-style segmented control (7d / 14d pill toggle). Auto-disable dates beyond max range. Add "Max 15 days" hint.

### U-51 — Missing "Generate report" button (§10.7)

- **Effort**: Low
- **Impact**: Low-Medium
- **Location**: `StatsView`
- **Problem**: "Generate report (last 30 days)" entry point not visible during audit. Feature exists in code but may be unreachable.
- **Fix**: Verify if removed or hidden by condition. Restore as prominent CTA card at bottom of "Resum de son" tab.

### U-52 — No save confirmation toast in baby profile (§11.1)

- **Effort**: Low
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Location**: `BabyDetailView`
- **Problem**: After "Desar canvis", button silently greys out. No toast, no animation. User must infer success from header updating. Silent save feels broken.
- **Fix**: Add native-style toast/snackbar: "Changes saved ✓" — auto-dismiss 2s. Use framer-motion spring.

### U-53 — Valid changes auto-save silently on back (§11.2)

- **Effort**: Low
- **Impact**: Low-Medium
- **Location**: `BabyDetailView:145-165`
- **Problem**: Partially addressed — a discard dialog exists for **invalid** changes (via `ConfirmationModal` + `showDiscardConfirm`). However, **valid** changes auto-save silently when tapping back, with no confirmation. User may not intend to save edits they were still reviewing.
- **Fix**: Show "Save changes?" confirmation on back for valid dirty state, instead of auto-saving. Or add the missing save toast (U-52) so at least the auto-save is communicated.

### U-55 — Avatar picker has no crop step (§11.4)

- **Effort**: Medium
- **Impact**: Low
- **Location**: `BabyAvatarPicker`
- **Problem**: File picker triggers immediately with no crop/preview step. Auto-compresses to 400x400 JPEG via Canvas API. **Loading spinner already exists** (`uploading` prop → spinner overlay). Only the crop UI is missing.
- **Fix**: Add circular crop overlay after file selection (like WhatsApp profile photo) so user can adjust framing before upload.

### U-56 — Minutes-from-midnight → Date objects in simulateDay (§6.5)

- **Effort**: Medium-High
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Location**: `dateUtils` (`simulateDay` internals)
- **Problem**: `simulateDay` still works entirely in minutes-from-midnight (0-1439) internally. `predictDaySchedule` already converts to Date objects at the boundary (U-40 done), so the external API is safe. The risk is limited to midnight-crossing edge cases inside `simulateDay` itself (e.g. night wakings at 23:30→00:15).
- **Fix**: Refactor `simulateDay` internals to use Date objects. Lower priority now that `predictDaySchedule` handles boundary conversion.
- **Dependencies**: U-40 done. Can be done independently.

### U-57 — Auto-overdue nap silent skip (§6.2)

- **Effort**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Location**: `TodayView`
- **Problem**: After 60min overdue (`OVERDUE_NAP_PERSISTENCE_MINUTES`), nap silently drops from predictions. **Note:** visual feedback exists for explicitly-skipped naps (via `skippedNapIndices` — dimmed, muted label), but auto-overdue naps simply vanish with no indicator. No "Recalculate day" button.
- **Fix**: When a nap auto-expires at 60min, show a transient "nap skipped" card or indicator + discreet "Recalculate day" button. Avoid modals (one-handed use at night).

### U-58 — Dynamic blending 70/30 by maturity (§6.4)

- **Effort**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Location**: `dateUtils`
- **Problem**: Fixed 70% config / 30% history weight regardless of data maturity. Doesn't leverage existing `getAlgorithmStatusTier()` tiers.
- **Fix**: Dynamic weight: 90/10 learning → 70/30 calibrating → 50/50 optimized. Gradual curve, not abrupt steps. Use existing calibration thresholds.

### U-59 — Accumulated wake time factor for bedtime (§6.6)

- **Effort**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Location**: `dateUtils`
- **Problem**: Bedtime calculation ignores total daytime wake time. Baby with many fragmented micro-naps accumulates more fatigue than algorithm predicts.
- **Fix**: Factor in accumulated wake time (sum of awake intervals since morning). If exceeding age threshold, reduce final wake window. Coordinate with U-41 (§6.1) as a single "fatigue state."
- **Dependencies**: After U-41 and U-40.

## P3 — Future / Infrastructure

### U-60 — Profiles table semantics — 1 user = 1 baby (§1)

- **Effort**: N/A (documentation / architectural awareness)
- **Impact**: N/A
- **Location**: `profiles` table
- **Problem**: `profiles` table stores both user-level and baby-level data in one row. One user can only have one "own" baby. Misleading schema.
- **Note**: Awareness item for §4 (multi-baby). When implementing multi-baby, split into `profiles` (user-only) + `babies` table.

### U-61 — Onboarding draft persistence across refresh (§2)

- **Effort**: Low
- **Impact**: Low
- **Location**: `OnboardingFlow`
- **Problem**: Refresh during onboarding loses all draft data. Optional improvement.
- **Fix**: Persist draft to localStorage (not sessionStorage, which is tab-scoped).

### U-62 — Supabase base schema migration (§3)

- **Effort**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Location**: `supabase/migrations/`
- **Problem**: Only `multi_user_sharing.sql` and later migrations in repo. `profiles` and `sleep_entries` assumed to exist but not created by any migration. Project not self-contained/reproducible.
- **Fix**: Add initial migration creating `profiles`, `sleep_entries`, and their RLS policies.

### U-63 — Multi-baby support (2+ babies per account) (§4)

- **Effort**: Very High
- **Impact**: High
- **Location**: App-wide + Supabase schema
- **Problem**: UI has "Add your baby" and active-baby switch, but backend is 1 user = 1 profile row = 1 baby. No `baby_id` on `sleep_entries`.
- **Fix**: (1) New `babies` table, (2) `profiles` user-only, (3) `sleep_entries` add `baby_id` FK, (4) `baby_shares` reference `baby_id`, (5) Update all hooks and RLS. See BACKLOG §4 for detailed schema plan.

### U-64 — Invitation emails production — Resend domain (§5)

- **Effort**: Low (operational)
- **Impact**: Low
- **Location**: Resend dashboard
- **Problem**: `onboarding@resend.dev` can only deliver to account owner. Need verified custom domain for real recipients.
- **Fix**: Verify domain in Resend dashboard.

### U-65 — Weekly newborn + monthly infant age brackets (§7)

- **Effort**: High
- **Impact**: Medium-High
- **Location**: `dateUtils` (`SLEEP_DEVELOPMENT_MAP`)
- **Problem**: Newborns (0-12 weeks) change rapidly but covered by only 2 brackets. Current map has 13 brackets for 0-24 months.
- **Fix**: (1) Research weekly granularity for 0-12 weeks, (2) Expand map with weekly newborn + monthly infant brackets, (3) Validate prediction engine handles increased resolution, (4) Extend app range to 24 months.
- **Dependencies**: Best after U-40 (§6.3 unification).

## Removed

### ~~U-35 — LandingLanguagePicker uses white/ tokens~~

- **Status**: Fixed — all `white/` values replaced with `var(--glass-bg)`, `var(--text-primary)`, `var(--text-secondary)` tokens.

### ~~U-44 — Playwright click timeouts on all buttons (§8.3)~~

- **Status**: Removed — not an app code bug.
- **Root cause**: Playwright MCP's synthetic pointer simulation doesn't complete through framer-motion's drag listeners + `touch-action: none` CSS. App buttons use standard `onClick`, drag is scoped to `motion.div` containers, no global event hijacking. Real device taps work fine. `page.evaluate()` workaround bypasses the pointer layer entirely.
- **Action**: Test tooling config issue. Address in Playwright test setup if E2E automation is needed.
