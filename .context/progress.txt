# Progress

## Design Audit — Phase 1: Critical (2026-02-09) [COMPLETED]

- [x] #1 Hero card: replaced hardcoded `bg-white/[0.06]` with `var(--glass-bg)` / `var(--glass-border)` / `var(--shadow-md)`

- [x] #5 Prediction labels: "Predicted Nap" → "Nap {n}", "Catnap" → "Short Nap"
- [x] #6 Removed redundant "My Babies" ListRow from ProfileMenu (baby card is the sole entry point)

## Design Audit — Phase 2: Refinement (2026-02-09) [COMPLETED]

- [x] #9 Extracted shared `SubViewHeader` component; wired into all 5 sub-views (MyBabiesView, AccountSettingsView, FAQsView, ContactView, SupportView) — removed 5 duplicate BackIcon definitions
- [x] #10 Standardised `ListRow` in ProfileMenu with theme-aware glassmorphism; exported for reuse
- [x] #11 SupportView now imports `ListRow` from ProfileMenu — removed duplicate ListRow, ChevronRightIcon, BackIcon
- [x] #12 Replaced all remaining hardcoded `white/` glassmorphism: ProfileMenu baby card + empty state, SupportView tip card, MyBabiesView BabyProfileCard + AddBabyGhostCard + PlusIcon circle, StatusPill
- [x] #13 Replaced random encouraging messages with time-contextual function (morning/afternoon/evening/night)
- [x] #14 Removed emoji from ContactView subtitle; rewrote copy to match tone
- [x] #15 Wrapper div cleanup was already resolved in Phase 1 (single `space-y-3` wrapping both remaining rows)

## Design Audit — Phase 3: Polish (2026-02-09) [COMPLETED]

- [x] ProfileSection: Added AnimatePresence `mode="wait"` with directional spring slide transitions (stiffness: 300, damping: 30, ±60px). Forward drill-in slides right→left, back slides left→right. Replaced static `fade-in` class.
- [x] TodayView timeline: Added staggered `motion.div` entrance animations (staggerChildren: 0.06s, per-card spring: stiffness 400, damping 30, y: 12→0). All 6 card types wrapped.
- [x] TodayView section label: "Today's Timeline" → "Your Day"
- [x] Bonus: Morning Wake Up card — replaced last `bg-white/[0.06]` with `color-mix(in srgb, var(--wake-color) 6%, var(--glass-bg))`

## Full Codebase Light-Mode Sweep (2026-02-09) [COMPLETED]

Triggered by BabyEditSheet appearing as a black modal in morning/afternoon themes.
Audited all components and fixed every remaining `white/` and hardcoded hex colour.

- [x] BabyEditSheet: `bg-[#1a1c24]/95` → `var(--bg-card)`, all `white/` → theme tokens, `text-red-400` → `var(--danger-color)`
- [x] StatsView: 6 glassmorphism cards → `var(--glass-bg)` + `var(--glass-border)` + `var(--shadow-sm)`, tooltips, insight tag, date range filter, empty state
- [x] SkeletonTimelineCard: 6× `bg-white/10` → `bg-[var(--text-muted)]/15`
- [x] QuickActionSheet: drag handle `bg-white/20` → `bg-[var(--text-muted)]/25`
- [x] DayNavigator: 2× `hover:bg-white/5` → `hover:bg-[var(--text-muted)]/10`
- [x] MissingBedtimeModal: `hover:bg-white/10` → `hover:bg-[var(--text-muted)]/10`, `border-white/5` → `border-[var(--glass-border)]`
- [x] SleepEntrySheet: `hover:text-[#B07D7D]` → `hover:text-[var(--danger-color)]`
- [x] SleepEntry: `bg-[#ff7e5f]/20` + `text-[#ff7e5f]` → `var(--night-color)` tokens
- [x] TodayView: loading skeleton `bg-white/10` → `bg-[var(--text-muted)]/15`

## Baby Profile Redesign + SleepEntrySheet Polish (2026-02-09) [COMPLETED]

- [x] Task 1: Unified Interactive Baby Card — `active:brightness-[1.12]` feedback, "Tap to edit" inline for all owned babies
- [x] Task 2: Baby Management Flow Redesign — new `BabyDetailView.tsx` full-screen, routing in `ProfileSection.tsx`, `MyBabiesView` simplified (ShareAccess moved to detail view, BabyEditSheet only for add)
- [x] Task 3: Temporal Validation — `computeDurationMinutes()`, validation useMemo (block 0-duration/excessive, warn cross-midnight/long), error/warning messages, save button disabled on invalid
- [x] Task 4: SleepEntrySheet Polish — `items-start` alignment, arrow `pt-2`, delete icon full opacity, dynamic labels (duration under start, relative "ago" under end), Play/Stop/Check icons, removed standalone duration section

## DayNavigator Redesign (2026-02-10) [COMPLETED]

- [x] New props in App.tsx: `datesWithEntries` (Set) and `babyAge` (string) computed via `useMemo`, passed to DayNavigator
- [x] Date header: tappable "Today" / "February 10" + chevron, opens calendar modal. Baby age subtitle below
- [x] Week strip: 7-day Mon–Sun grid, selected day accent circle, today ring, entry dots, swipeable ±1 week (Framer Motion `drag="x"`)
- [x] Calendar modal: bottom sheet (spring, drag-to-dismiss), month navigation, full calendar grid with entry dots, "Back to today" + "Close" buttons
- [x] Bug fix: day letter colour — `text-[var(--text-on-accent)]` → `text-[var(--nap-color)]` (visible on dark bg)
- [x] Bug fix: calendar z-index — Tailwind `z-[60]` didn't override CSS `z-index: 50` on nav. Used inline `style={{ zIndex: 100 }}`
- [x] Extra `pb-28` on calendar footer to clear floating nav bar

## StatsView Enhancements (2026-02-11) [COMPLETED]

- [x] Bedtime trend area chart (mirrors Woke Up chart, `--night-color` theming, average reference line)
- [x] Daily Schedule Gantt chart (custom div-based, wake-up dots + nap bars + bedtime dots per day)
- [x] Dynamic legend based on max nap count in data

## UX Fixes (2026-02-11) [COMPLETED]

- [x] Scroll to top on tab switch (`window.scrollTo(0, 0)` in `handleViewChange`)
- [x] Freeze predicted nap/bedtime ghost cards during active nap (ref-based snapshot)
- [x] StatsView date range picker: replaced `sr-only` + `showPicker()` with transparent overlay `<input type="date">`
- [x] Avg Nap Time: fixed to per-nap average (totalNapMinutes / totalNapCount), not per-day total
- [x] KPI reorder: Total Sleep → Night Sleep → Nap Time → Naps/Day
- [x] Active nap/bedtime editing: removed WakeUpSheet routing, fixed SleepEntrySheet to only auto-end on pure Stop (no changes)

## ProfileMenu Simplification (2026-02-11) [COMPLETED]

- [x] Removed hero baby card (avatar, name, age) from ProfileMenu
- [x] Removed algorithm status card, StatusPill, SparklesIcon
- [x] Three clean Napper-style ListRows: My Babies → Settings → Support (icon left, text centre, arrow right)
- [x] Cleaned up unused prop chain: algorithmStatus removed from App → ProfileSection → ProfileMenu
- [x] Removed unused imports (extractWakeWindowsFromEntries, getSleepConfigForAge, determineCalibrationState, AlgorithmStatusCard, BabyAvatarPicker, calculateAge)

## Other Pending Items

- [ ] Delete Account button is a TODO (does nothing) — AccountSettingsView
- [ ] Resend domain verification for production invitation emails
- [ ] Delete Baby functionality — confirmation shows but doesn't actually delete the baby profile
