## 1. Brand Overview

### 1.1 Brand Essence

NapNap is a rhythmic companion for sleep-deprived parents.

It does not overwhelm with data.  
It does not entertain.  
It does not diagnose.

It gently tells you what to do next.

### 1.2 Positioning Statement

For sleep-deprived parents who want clear, trusted guidance instead of guesswork, NapNap is a web-based baby sleep companion that calmly tells you what to do next using research-based schedules and a night-optimized, non-judgmental experience.

### 1.3 Core Idea

Rhythm creates calm.

Sleep is not random.  
Sleep follows cycles.  
NapNap helps parents move in sync with those cycles.

### 1.4 Tagline

**Find your rhythm.**

Spanish:  
**Encuentra tu ritmo.**
