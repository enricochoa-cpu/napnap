# 2026-02-24 — Stats Y-axis, onboarding completed flag, ESSENTIAL-GAPS §6

## Summary

### Stats Y-axis (duration + growth)
- **Stats charts Y-axis:** Fixed wrong or duplicate Y-axis labels on Sleep Trends charts (Average nap, Daily Sleep, Sleep summary) and Growth (weight/height). Recharts was auto-generating ticks that, when formatted (e.g. `Math.round(value/60)}h`), produced repeated labels (e.g. 0h, 1h, 1h, 1h).
- **Duration charts:** Added `durationAxisProps()` (domain 0–max rounded to 30 min, ticks every 30 min) and `formatDurationAxis()` (0h, 30m, 1h, 1h 30m, …). All duration Y-axes now use explicit `domain`, `ticks`, and this formatter.
- **Growth charts:** Added `weightAxisTicks()` and `heightAxisTicks()` to derive readable steps from existing adaptive domain (e.g. 3, 3.5, 4 kg; 50, 55, 60 cm). Weight and height Y-axes now use explicit `ticks` in both main Growth section and no-sleep block.

### Onboarding — “Has completed onboarding” (returning users → Login)
- **storage.ts:** New key `ONBOARDING_COMPLETED`; set when profile is created after onboarding so returning users can skip Entry choice.
- **App.tsx:** On successful `createProfile()` after applying onboarding draft, call `setToStorage(STORAGE_KEYS.ONBOARDING_COMPLETED, true)`.
- **AuthGuard.tsx:** Initial `entryChoice` state: if `getFromStorage(STORAGE_KEYS.ONBOARDING_COMPLETED, false)` is true, set to `'account'` so the user sees Login directly instead of “Get started” / “I have an account”.

### ESSENTIAL-GAPS.md
- **§2 Onboarding:** Retitled to “Optional draft persistence”; “Has completed onboarding” marked done; summary updated.
- **§6 Prediction system:** New section (Catalan) with 6.1–6.6: bedtime flexibility (sleep debt), overdue nap UX, unify double nap calculation, dynamic 70/30 blending, minutes-from-midnight → Date, accumulated wake time. Quick reference table and suggested order of work updated; recommended sequence for §6 added.

### Stats charts UX (axis spacing, day name, Napper-quality)
- **Y-axis tick count:** Capped at 4–6 ticks per axis (duration: step 30min–3h by range; time-of-day: round clock ticks; growth: max 6). Avoids label clutter (lesson §7.3).
- **Day name above date:** Custom `DayDateTick` shows weekday (e.g. Wed / mié.) above date (e.g. 18/2) on all date-based X-axes. `dayName` added to rangeData, wakeUp/bedtime points, averageNapChartData, weightChartData, heightChartData; locale via `getDateFnsLocale()`.
- **Axis spacing:** `CHART_MARGIN` constant: left 24, bottom 28 (was left 10, bottom 14) so "0h" and first "Wed" don’t crowd the corner; day/date labels sit clear of the chart. DayDateTick first line +4px offset for breathing room.

## Technical notes

- StatsView.tsx: `durationAxisProps`, `formatDurationAxis`, `weightAxisTicks`, `heightAxisTicks`; `averageNapAxis`, `dailySleepAxis`, `weightTicks`, `heightTicks` useMemos; all relevant YAxis components use `domain`/`ticks`/`tickFormatter` as appropriate. `CHART_MARGIN`, `DayDateTick`, `timeOfDayAxisTicks`; weightChartData/heightChartData with dayName.
- No change to data or domain logic for weight/height; only tick generation for clearer labels.
- Onboarding completed is device-local (localStorage); clearing storage or new device shows Entry choice again.
