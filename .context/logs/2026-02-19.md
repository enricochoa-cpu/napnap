## Sleep Log: add entry via FAB only

All add-entry actions now go through the FAB (QuickActionSheet). The Sleep Log (History) screen no longer has its own "+ Add Entry" button or dropdown.

### Changes

1. **App.tsx — History view**
   - Removed "+ Add Entry" button and Nap/Bedtime dropdown from the Sleep Log header.
   - Header now shows only the "Sleep Log" title and, when there is no baby, the "Add a baby to log sleep" link.
   - Removed `showAddEntryMenu` state and unused `CloudIconSmall` / `MoonIconSmall` components.

2. **SleepList.tsx**
   - Empty-state copy updated from "Tap '+ Add Entry' to log past sleep" to "Use the + button below to log past sleep".

### Rationale

Single entry point for adding sleep (FAB) keeps the UI consistent and avoids duplicate controls. History remains for viewing/editing; adding is always via the bottom + button from any tab.

### Files touched

- `src/App.tsx` — History header simplified, dead code removed
- `src/components/SleepList.tsx` — empty state copy
- `.context/` — MEMORY, progress, CLAUDE, app_flow, lessons updated
