The app is designed for night-time and one-handed use, with a calm, non-judgmental tone."
    },
    "1": {
      "question": "What is a wake window?",
      "answer": "A **wake window** is the amount of time your baby can comfortably stay awake between sleep periods.\n\nWake windows vary by age:\n- **0-4 weeks**: 45-60 minutes\n- **4-12 weeks**: 60-90 minutes\n- **3-4 months**: 75-120 minutes\n- **5-7 months**: 2-3 hours\n- **8-12 months**: 2.5-4 hours\n- **12-18 months**: 4-6 hours\n\nWatching for your baby's sleepy cues within these windows helps prevent overtiredness. NapNap uses age-based wake windows to suggest when to offer the next nap or bedtime."

      "question": "What is a micro-nap and should I be concerned?",
      "answer": "A **micro-nap** (or \"cat nap\") is a short sleep lasting only 20-30 minutes, typically just one sleep cycle.\n\n**Why it happens:**\n- Baby wakes between sleep cycles and hasn't learned to self-soothe\n- Undertired or overtired at nap time\n- Sleep environment issues (too bright, noisy)\n\n**Is it normal?**\nYes! Micro-naps are very common, especially under 5-6 months. Many babies naturally consolidate naps around 6 months as their sleep matures.\n\n**Tips:**\n- Ensure appropriate wake windows\n- Create a dark, quiet sleep environment\n- Stay consistent with your routine"

    "3": {
      "question": "What is a sleep regression?",
      "answer": "A **sleep regression** is a period when a baby who was sleeping well suddenly has trouble falling asleep, wakes frequently, or takes shorter naps.\n\n**Common regression ages:**\n- **4 months**: Sleep architecture changes permanently\n- **8-10 months**: Separation anxiety, crawling, standing\n- **12 months**: Walking, dropping to one nap\n- **18 months**: Toddler independence, language explosion\n\n**How long do they last?**\nTypically 2-6 weeks if you stay consistent with your approach.\n\n**What helps:**\n- Maintain consistent routines\n- Offer extra comfort without creating new sleep associations\n- Adjust wake windows if needed\n- Be patient – this is temporary!"
    },
    "4": {
      "question": "How do I know if my baby is overtired?",
      "answer": "An **overtired baby** has been awake too long and their body produces cortisol (stress hormone), making it *harder* to fall and stay asleep.\n\n**Signs of overtiredness:**\n- Rubbing eyes, pulling ears\n- Yawning excessively\n- Fussiness and irritability\n- Arching back, stiff limbs\n- Hyperactive behavior (counterintuitive!)\n- Fighting sleep desperately\n\n**Prevention:**\n- Learn your baby's wake windows for their age\n- Watch for early sleepy cues\n- Start the nap routine *before* they seem tired\n\n**Recovery:**\nAn earlier bedtime (even 30-60 minutes) can help break the overtired cycle."
    },
    "5": {
      "question": "What are sleepy cues?",
      "answer": "**Sleepy cues** are signals your baby gives when they're getting tired and ready for sleep.\n\n**Early cues** (ideal time to start nap routine):\n- Staring off into space\n- Less active, calmer movements\n- Losing interest in toys or people\n- Slight eye redness\n\n**Late cues** (may already be overtired):\n- Eye rubbing\n- Yawning\n- Ear or hair pulling\n- Fussiness\n\n**Very late cues** (overtired):\n- Crying\n- Arching back\n- Hyperactivity\n- Difficult to soothe\n\n**Tip:** Aim to catch the early cues. If you wait for yawning and eye rubbing, you may have already missed the optimal sleep window."

    "6": {
      "question": "Is it normal for night sleep to be longer than naps?",
      "answer": "**Yes, absolutely!** Night sleep and day sleep develop differently.\n\n**Why nights are longer:**\n- Melatonin (sleep hormone) is produced in darkness\n- Baby's circadian rhythm naturally supports longer night stretches\n- Sleep pressure builds throughout the day\n\n**Typical patterns:**\n- **Newborns**: Night and day may be confused initially\n- **2-3 months**: Longest stretch starts appearing at night (4-6 hours)\n- **4-6 months**: Night sleep consolidates (8-12 hours with feeds)\n- **6+ months**: Many babies can sleep 10-12 hours at night\n\n**Naps remain shorter** because daytime sleep pressure is lower and environmental factors (light, noise) affect sleep differently.\n\nDon't worry if naps are 30-45 minutes while nights are much longer – this is biologically normal!"
    },
    "7": {
      "question": "What are circadian rhythm and sleep pressure?",
      "answer": "**Circadian rhythm** is your baby's internal body clock. It helps align sleep with day and night (more melatonin in the dark, more alert in the light). Over the first months, babies develop a longer stretch at night partly because of this.\n\n**Sleep pressure** (homeostatic drive) is the need to sleep that builds the longer someone is awake. NapNap's suggestions work with both: we use wake windows (sleep pressure) and time-of-day (circadian rhythm) to suggest nap times and a reasonable bedtime."
    },
    "8": {
      "question": "What is a sleep cycle?",
      "answer": "A **sleep cycle** is a block of light and deep sleep (and sometimes brief waking) before the body moves into the next cycle. In babies, one cycle is often around 30–45 minutes.\n\nMany short naps are one cycle: baby wakes between cycles and hasn't yet learned to link them. That's why you might see 30-minute naps in NapNap—they're normal. As your baby gets older, naps often lengthen as they consolidate cycles."
    },
    "science": {
      "question": "Where does NapNap get its science from?",
      "answer": "NapNap's suggestions are based on widely used infant sleep guidelines and research:\n\n- **Wake windows and age-based nap counts**: Aligned with evidence-based ranges used in pediatric sleep resources (e.g. [National Sleep Foundation](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/baby-sleep), [AAP](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/default.aspx)) and common clinical practice for 0–18 months.\n- **Circadian development**: Use of morning wake-up and time-of-day for bedtime follows established understanding of how infant circadian rhythm develops in the first year.\n- **Short-nap compensation**: Adjusting the next wake window after a short nap reflects the idea that less daytime sleep increases sleep pressure sooner; this is a practical approach used in many parent-facing sleep resources.\n\nNapNap is a tool to support you, not a substitute for professional advice. If you have concerns about your baby's sleep or health, please speak with your pediatrician or a qualified sleep consultant."
